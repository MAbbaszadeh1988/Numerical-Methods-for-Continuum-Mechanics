# Numerical-Methods-for-Continuum-Mechanics

This repository contains teaching materials and example codes for the course Numerical Methods for Continuum Mechanics. The repository is intended to support students in understanding and implementing numerical techniques used in continuum mechanics and computational engineering.

📘 Course Description

Continuum mechanics problems often lead to partial differential equations that cannot be solved analytically for realistic engineering applications. This course introduces numerical methods used to approximate and solve these problems.

The course focuses on the formulation, implementation, and analysis of numerical algorithms with applications in solid and fluid mechanics.

🎯 Learning Objectives

After completing this course, students should be able to:

Understand the mathematical formulation of continuum mechanics problems

Derive weak and discrete formulations of governing equations

Implement numerical methods for solving boundary value and initial value problems

Develop and test computational models

Analyze numerical stability, accuracy, and convergence

Apply numerical methods to engineering applications
